## Questions? 

What questions do you have? What would like us to take a close look at when reviewing your HW?

	I put some specific questions in my code. 
	
	When I put in dynamic data for my templates in the html, like {{counter}}, should I always assume or use {{counter}} as a key in an object I'll define in my index.js? Like is that the basic way I should use dynamic data, as a key in an object I'll define later. At first I wanted to make {{counter}} correspond to a number that would change as the user pushes + and - but then I got stuck and looked back at the example we did in class, and just kind of followed that method. 

	Also the {{if}} is just used to make additional keys that would manipulate our View if we need something extra modified? Can you explain what the {{if}} actually means? I don't understand how something inside of "class=" can become a key (like "high" and "low") like {{counter}}. How do they all become keys in an object? 

	Just to understand templates semantically, whenever one needs some element of the application to change based on User input, that's when you use templates? Like dynamic data in html is basically the cornerstone of templates?
